				<h3>Intro</h3>
				<p class="description">What is polymer clay?</p>
			</header>
				<p>Polymer clay is a versatile and popular medium used for crafting and sculpting. It's made from a PVC-based compound that can be molded and hardened when heated. Polymer clay comes in various colors and can be mixed to create new shades. It's a fantastic material for creating jewelry, figurines, home decor, and much more. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of working with polymer clay.</p>

				<h3>Exploring the Top Polymer Clay Brands</h3>
				<p class="description">Discover the characteristics, strengths, and considerations of three popular polymer clay brands to help you make an informed decision when selecting your clay of choice.</p>
			</header>

				<p><b>Sculpey: </b>Sculpey is a well-known brand offering a wide range of polymer clay options. It is known for its softness and ease of conditioning, making it ideal for beginners. Sculpey clay has a smooth texture and is available in vibrant colors. However, it can be more prone to breakage and may require additional care when handling and baking. <img src="https://www.potterycrafts.co.uk/image.php?filename=100-141.jpg&stockcode=100-141&category=0035002300160001&width=1000&height=1000" alt="Sculpey brand clay"></p>

				
				<p><b>Fimo: </b>Fimo is a trusted brand that offers a variety of polymer clay lines suitable for different projects. Fimo clay is known for its firmness, which makes it excellent for achieving fine details and intricate designs. It maintains its shape well during sculpting and has good strength after baking. However, it may require more effort to condition compared to softer clays. <img src="https://www.craftmill.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/3adf4596d7ae773ba81f33a2fa071c83/f/i/fimo_033_brilliant_blue_1.jpg" alt="fimo brand clay"></p>

				<p><b>Considerations: </b>When selecting a polymer clay brand, factors such as personal preference, project requirements, and desired characteristics play a significant role. It's essential to experiment with different brands and find the one that aligns with your artistic style and project needs.</p>

				<p>Remember that these brand comparisons are based on general observations, and individual experiences may vary. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations for optimal results.</p>

				<h3>Preparation</h3>
					<p>You should properly prepare your work area before starting.</p>
			</header>
				<ol>
					<li>Gather your supplies: Start by collecting the necessary materials, including polymer clay in your preferred colors, a clean work surface, sculpting tools (like clay shapers, blades, and texture tools), a rolling pin or pasta machine, and an oven or UV lamp for curing.</li>
					<li>Set up your workspace: Make sure your work area is clean and well-lit. Cover the surface with parchment paper or a non-stick mat to prevent the clay from sticking.</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Creating Designs</h3>
					<p>Planning your polymer clay creations</p>
				</header>
				<ol>
					<li>Brainstorm and sketch: Before diving into sculpting, it's helpful to plan your design. Consider the shape, size, and style of your creation. Sketch out your ideas to have a visual reference.</li>
					<li>Color mixing: Polymer clay can be blended to create unique colors. Soften the clay by kneading it in your hands and then mix the desired colors together until you achieve the desired shade.</li>
					<li>Texturing and embellishing: Use various tools to create textures or add details to your clay. You can press textures onto the clay surface, carve patterns, or add small accents like beads or rhinestones.</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Sculpting</h3>
					<p>Sculpting with Polymer Clay</p>
				</header>
				<ol>
					<li>Condition the clay: Start by warming up the clay in your hands or running it through a pasta machine on the thickest setting. This process makes the clay more pliable and removes air bubbles.
					</li>
					<li>Building the base: Begin with a simple shape or armature (a wire skeleton) to support your sculpture if needed. Gradually add and shape the clay to form your design, paying attention to proportions and details.
					</li>
					<li>Refining and smoothing: Use your sculpting tools to refine the details, smooth out any rough surfaces, and blend different clay colors together seamlessly.</li>
				</ol>
		</section>

		<section class="main-section" id="curing">
			<header>
				<h3>Curing the Clay</h3>
			</header>
				<ol>
					<li>Oven curing: Follow the manufacturer's instructions for baking polymer clay in a home oven. Typically, preheat the oven to the recommended temperature (usually between <code>200-275°F</code> or <code>93-135°C</code>) and place your creation on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Bake for the suggested time (usually around <code>15-30 minutes per 1/4 inch or 6mm of thickness</code>). Avoid overbaking as it may result in discoloration or brittleness.
					</li>
					<li>UV resin curing: Some polymer clay brands offer UV-curable options. Apply a thin layer of UV resin to your finished clay creation, making sure to cover all areas. Place the piece under a UV lamp according to the resin manufacturer's instructions. The curing time can vary but is typically a few minutes per side.
					</li>
				</ol>
